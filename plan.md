#THE PLAN

1. Build a dead simple rails app to CRUD the things I need
2. Add a Mobile app that's just a shell of the website... maybe with jsonette.
3. Gradually port over/implement any native functionality as needed
4. Gradually transition the rails app to an API (maybe not so gradually)
5. Bit by bit as we transition to an API for the rails app, make the mobile app code call into the API and implement features "natively" or at least with React Native
6. Feel free to replace the API with Spring Boot so that future development is awesome and we can scale easily.
7. Celebrate??
